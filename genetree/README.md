## Construct ML gene trees with iqtree
- For sequences file without alignment, run `alignment_iqtree.sh`.
- For sequences file aligned and export from MEGA, run `iqtree.sh` directly.
## Visualise the tree
- This is a batch visualisation script which will create a `pptx` file for each tree. Run `genetree.R` with your given genelist.
