# Gene family evolution and genome structure analysis
1. Prepare files for [orthofinder](https://github.com/davidemms/OrthoFinder) analysis.
2. Synteny plot using orthofinder results.
3. Summarise gene family gain and loss results.
4. Functional annotation of gene family gain/loss/duplication on the phylogenetic tree.
