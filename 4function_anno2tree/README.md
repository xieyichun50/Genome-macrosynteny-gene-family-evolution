## Functional annotation of nodes and tips on the tree
Run Rscripts one-by-one to get enriched annotations of each node and tip on the species tree.
They might take some time to go ~ ~ ~

Take the myriapod genome analysis for example
To annotate specific clades, unmask and edit the species list of [02orthogroups2function-myriapod.R](https://github.com/xieyichun50/Genome-macrosynteny-gene-family-evolution/blob/main/4function_anno2tree/02orthogroups2function-myriapod.R), and you will get a pseudogenome (ancestral state) functional annotation "database", with GO, KOG, KEGG and KO annotations.

There might be "NULL" printed on the screen when running some scripts, that is normal and don't worry.
